          Casual trekkers along the Pacific Coast Highway have discoverd 3 new species of Pokemon. These
          species had
          previously only been theorised and the is is the first that any human has seen these in the wild.
          Initial reports
          suggest that these pokemon are not particularly dangerous and appear quite friendly to humans. They
          seem especially fond of candy. One of the trekkers who first spotted Bulbasaur said.

          This is one of the cutes Pokemon we've ever seen. We could not believe we saw something like this.
          This is the happiest day of my life.

          Researchers are elated and cannot wait to find more such hidden Pokemon. Some researchers believe
          over 200 such species exist in the wild.
